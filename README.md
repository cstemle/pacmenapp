# pacmenapp.github.io

## About This Project
This application is an example of using Javascript for DOM manipulation. The application is designed so that the "Pacmen" are continually added to the screen with each click of the button.

## Directions
Simply press "Start Game" to initate and press the corresponding button to add more characters to the ring!

## Future Roadmap
The goal for the future is to continually work on the effects until I can achieve extremely realistic results.
